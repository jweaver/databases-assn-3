CSCI 585 - Databases Homework #3
============

## Oracle Spatial Database Java App
Use Vagrant to bootstrap the VM.  Use SQL files to load and query.

** Warning ** May or may not work depending on your versions of OpenBox and Vagrant.  YMMV, Good luck.

** Second Warning ** This little homework was hacked together in a single night (really), and as such is to never be used as an example of what to do in real life or production.  Quality and commitment/longevity suffer in school assignments and are not reflective of how things should be done in real life ;-).
